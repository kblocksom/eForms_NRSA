# eForms_NRSA

## Description
This project contains R Shiny code for parsing JSON files from the NRSA 2018-19 mobile app, which will allows app users to format and keep an initial copy of their data for examination. It requires users to save all of the files from a site visit in a single folder and produces an Excel file with worksheets for each data type or a set of comma-delimited (.csv) files in a .zip file. Once the data are parsed, a simple landowner report based on field-collected data can be produced as an .html file. The minimum data files required for creating the landowner report are: verification, assessment, field, samples, and fish gear.
